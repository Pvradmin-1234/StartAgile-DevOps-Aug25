Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


****************************************

CREATION OF COMPILE JOB
***********************************

1. new Job --complie-->freestyle project
2. Source code management --> select git
--->give git path ===> https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git

3. build ==> select invoke top level maven targets
   select maven version===> mymaven
    goal ==> compile
4. save ==> build now 
So all the compiled files will be present at this location
==> look for this line in console output at the end on jenkins
Compiling 13 source files to /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/compile1/target/classes

5. Go to workspace on the left side of jenkins Job compile
In the folder go to ==> target folder==> go to classes/com/edurekademo
==> click on edurekademo==> got to utilities==> all class files will be there which have recently been compiled.
******************************
2nd JOB ==>Code Review
*********************

Jenkins--> new item--> Name= code Review==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> 
give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git

Step 2: build ==> invoke top level maven target==>
 select maven version==>mymaven ==> goal = pmd:pmd

save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

Goto Workspace on the left side of jenkins Job code review
In the folder go to ==> target folder ==> you will find pmd.xml file.

CONVERT FILE TO TREND REPORT
*******************************
 manage jenkins--> manage plugins--> available --> Search for warning next gen plugin--> install it.
Retsrat in case plugin fails installation.

Now go to the job Code Review==> go to post build actions ==> select recordcomplier warnings and static result analysis

Under tool ==> select PMD
under report file format ==> give path of pmd.xml file ie:  target/pmd.xml
or as mentioned in message below : copy **/pmd.xml  ( no quotes)

Save the file and build now.

After the build is successfull, you will see PMD Warnings

So you will see 12 new warning have been generated on the code.
Scroll down 
Under package click on first one to check warnings.

*********************************
JOB3: Testing --Unit Test report
********************************

1. jenkins--> new item--> Name= unitTest==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git
2. build ==> invoke top level maven target==> select maven version==>mymaven ==> goal = test

3. Save and Build now.

4. Check the workspace

5. surefire-reports will be present

But we cannot understand them easily. So lets generate understandable reports by using Junit reports option under post build actions

6. Go back to job==> post build actions==> select junit test result job
==> give target/surefire-reports/*.xml  ===>under test report xml
This is path where xml files are there.
Here *.xml is as we want to use all the xml files

7. Save and build again

Go to build number ===> on left side you will see Test Result 
Click on it and you can see all pass and fail details of the tests

**********************************
Job5 Package Job

Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Package==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git
 
build ==> invoke top level maven target==>mymaven

==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console
